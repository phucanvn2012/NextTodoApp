When the driver gives up, the mongoose connection emits a `reconnectFailed` event. This option does nothing for replica set connections.\n * @param {Number} [options.reconnectInterval=1000] See `reconnectTries` option above.\n * @param {Class} [options.promiseLibrary] Sets the [underlying driver's promise library](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/api/MongoClient.html).\n * @param {Number} [options.poolSize=5] The maximum number of sockets the MongoDB driver will keep open for this connection. By default, `poolSize` is 5. Keep in mind that, as of MongoDB 3.4, MongoDB only allows one operation per socket at a time, so you may want to increase this if you find you have a few slow queries that are blocking faster queries from proceeding. See [Slow Trains in MongoDB and Node.js](http://thecodebarbarian.com/slow-trains-in-mongodb-and-nodejs).\n * @param {Number} [options.bufferMaxEntries] The MongoDB driver also has its own buffering mechanism that kicks in when the driver is disconnected. Set this option to 0 and set `bufferCommands` to `false` on your schemas if you want your database operations to fail immediately when the driver is not connected, as opposed to waiting for reconnection.\n * @param {Number} [options.connectTimeoutMS=30000] How long the MongoDB driver will wait before killing a socket due to inactivity _during initial connection_. Defaults to 30000. This option is passed transparently to [Node.js' `socket#setTimeout()` function](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_settimeout_timeout_callback).\n * @param {Number} [options.socketTimeoutMS=30000] How long the MongoDB driver will wait before killing a socket due to inactivity _after initial connection_. A socket may be inactive because of either no activity or a long-running operation. This is set to `30000` by default, you should set this to 2-3x your longest running operation if you expect some of your database operations to run longer than 20 seconds. This option is passed to [Node.js `socket#setTimeout()` function](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_settimeout_timeout_callback) after the MongoDB driver successfully completes.\n * @param {Number} [options.family=0] Passed transparently to [Node.js' `dns.lookup()`](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dns_dns_lookup_hostname_options_callback) function.

If not listening, the event bubbles to the connection used to create this Model.\n * @event `index`: Emitted after `Model#ensureIndexes` completes. If an error occurred it is passed with the event.\n * @event `index-single-start`: Emitted when an individual index starts within `Model#ensureIndexes`. The fields and options being used to build the index are also passed with the event.\n * @event `index-single-done`: Emitted when an individual index finishes within `Model#ensureIndexes`.

If overwrite is true, sent without the $set wrapper.\n *\n * This helps prevent accidentally overwriting all documents in your collection with `{ name: 'jason bourne' }`.\n *\n * ####Note:\n *\n * Be careful to not use an existing model instance for the update clause (this won't work and can cause weird behavior like infinite loops). Also, ensure that the update clause does not have an _id property, which causes Mongo to return a \"Mod on _id not allowed\" error.\n *\n * ####Note:\n *\n * Mongoose casts values and runs setters when using update.

Provided in MongoDB > 2.0.X\n * - `verbose` {Boolean, default:false} provide statistics on job execution time.\n * - `readPreference` {String}\n * - `out*` {Object, default: {inline:1}} sets the output target for the map reduce job.\n *\n * ####* out options:\n *\n * - `{inline:1}` the results are returned in an array\n * - `{replace: 'collectionName'}` add the results to collectionName: the results replace the collection\n * - `{reduce: 'collectionName'}` add the results to collectionName: if dups are detected, uses the reducer / finalize functions\n * - `{merge: 'collectionName'}` add the results to collectionName: if dups exist the new docs overwrite the old\n *\n * If `options.out` is set to `replace`, `merge`, or `reduce`, a Model instance is returned that can be used for further querying. Queries run against this model are all executed with the [`lean` option](/docs/tutorials/lean.html); meaning only the js object is returned and no Mongoose magic is applied (getters, setters, etc).\n *\n * ####Example:\n *\n *     var o = {};\n *     // You can also define `map()` and `reduce()` as strings if your\n *     // linter complains about `emit()` not being defined\n *     o.map = 'function () { emit(this.name, 1) }';\n *     o.reduce = 'function (k, vals) { return vals.length }';\n *     o.out = { replace: 'createdCollectionNameForResults' }\n *     o.verbose = true;\n *\n *     User.mapReduce(o, function (err, model, stats) {\n *       console.log('map reduce took %d ms', stats.processtime)\n *       model.find().where('value').gt(10).exec(function (err, docs) {\n *         console.log(docs);\n *       });\n *     })\n *\n *     // `mapReduce()` returns a promise.

To find out more, details are available\n * [here](#error_messages_MongooseError.messages).\n *\n * If Mongoose's built-in error message templating isn't enough, Mongoose\n * supports setting the `message` property to a function.\n *\n *     schema.path('name').validate({\n *       validator: function() { return v.length > 5; },\n *       // `errors['name']` will be \"name must have length 5, got 'foo'\"\n *       message: function(props) {\n *         return `${props.path} must have length 5, got '${props.value}'`;\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * To bypass Mongoose's error messages and just copy the error message that\n * the validator throws, do this:\n *\n *     schema.path('name').validate({\n *       validator: function() { throw new Error('Oops!'); },\n *       // `errors['name']` will be \"Oops!\"\n *       message: function(props) { return props.reason.message; }\n *     });\n *\n * ####Asynchronous validation:\n *\n * Mongoose supports validators that return a promise. A validator that returns\n * a promise is called an _async validator_. Async validators run in\n * parallel, and `validate()` will wait until all async validators have settled.\n *\n *     schema.path('name').validate({\n *       validator: function (value) {\n *         return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n *           resolve(false); // validation failed\n *         });\n *       }\n *     });\n *\n * You might use asynchronous validators to retreive other documents from the database to validate against or to meet other I/O bound validation needs.\n *\n * Validation occurs `pre('save')` or whenever you manually execute [document#validate](#document_Document-validate).\n *\n * If validation fails during `pre('save')` and no callback was passed to receive the error, an `error` event will be emitted on your Models associated db [connection](#connection_Connection), passing the validation error object along.\n *\n *     var conn = mongoose.createConnection(..);\n *     conn.on('error', handleError);\n *\n *     var Product = conn.model('Product', yourSchema);\n *     var dvd = new Product(..);\n *     dvd.save(); // emits error on the `conn` above\n *\n * If you want to handle these errors at the Model level, add an `error`\n * listener to your Model as shown below.\n *\n *     // registering an error listener on the Model lets us handle errors more locally\n *     Product.on('error', handleError);\n *\n * @param {RegExp|Function|Object} obj validator function, or hash describing options\n * @param {Function} [obj.validator] validator function.
